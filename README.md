My first capstone project at Tech Elevator, developed in partnership with Melissa Hernandez.

This project was the culmination of our C# module.  We were tasked with using C#/.NET to apply OOP principles in the creation of a virtual vending machine application.  The application includes a CLI for user interaction, FILE I/O for providing the machine inventory as well as logging, and unit tests for regression testing.
